        <div class='mb-6'>Welcome to the National MUD Building Month! Like the more well known NaNoWriMo in Novemeber, NaMuBuMo is, at its heart, a celebration and trial of authorship. Writing up 100 rooms in 31 days doesn't sound quite as daunting as 50,000 words over 30 days but making an interesting world in those 100 rooms (or more) within that month will be more challenging than one might suspect. Like NaNoWriMo, participants are expected to craft this world within the confines of the given month, concept to completion. There is no one holding you to that or any other rule but yourself, of course, and there is nothing to gain other than personal satisfaction.</div>

        <div class='mb-6'>We invite all to take part not only to celebrate the craft of world building but as an opportunity to hone your craft and sharpen your skills. Build something you've never built before. There's no obligation to appeal to any specific audience and there is no one to please but yourself. Come build with us this October and with a bit of hope future Octobers to come as we declare the National MUD Builders Month!</div>

        <div class='mb-6'>If you want to participate but really don't know where to begin why not give <a href='https://writtenrealms.com'>Written Realms</a> a try and build out something there. Written Realms not only allows you to build your own world with an extensive set of administrative tooling on their website but they will host it and provide an advanced client for people to play it as well.</div>
