    "description": "(Early Access for NaMuBuMo - Testing the starting faction areas in preparation for PvP content in the future!) The honeyed blood of a murdered god, twice stolen, rains from the sky, spreading wisdom and terror where it lands. Three realms battle for the mead of poetry, and the earth itself writhes and twists with myth given shape. Side with the Humans of Midgard, the Jotunn of Jotunnheim, or the Dwarves of Nidavellir as you fight for vengeance, glory, and control of legend itself.",

    "description": "The Orbs of Escher is the 2019 NaMuBuMo submission for the Cleft of Dimensions. To explore the Orbs of Escher, connect to the Cleft of Dimensions, create a new character, and go 'up' as soon as you enter the game. The Orbs of Escher are written entirely by GPT-2, the transformer-based natural language processing AI published by OpenAI in February 2019. We fine-tuned GPT-2 to write MUD rooms by feeding it our entire full-scale MUD as a training corpus. After training, we instructed GPT-2 to write several thousand rooms, which we filtered for quality and stitched into the quilt that is the Orbs of Escher. Our human builders have primarily arranged and edited what GPT-2 has authored. The Orbs of Escher are sometimes surreal, sometimes poetic, and sometimes complete nonsense. We hope you will enjoy this experiment into a MUD area written by artificial intelligence.",
